This readme should explain how to use this Apps Script code to save the content of an existing Google+ Community in a new Firebase database.
Once all data have been imported in Firebase, it can be downloaded as a big JSON file to be reused somewhere else or as a raw archive.
It is also possible to use Firebase Hosting to deploy a web app and display all the Google+ community posts in the web app.
