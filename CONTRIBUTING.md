# Contributing to Google Plus Community Migrator

This is still a work in progress. Most G+ features are still missing. If you are a developer, do not hesitate to contribute, either by improving the Google Apps Script code to retrieve data from G+ or by improving the web app source code. Both are available on this repository.

## To contribute code:

- Fork the project and create a pull request

## To request features or report bugs:

- [Add an issue](https://github.com/RomainVialard/Google-Plus-Community-Migrator/issues)
